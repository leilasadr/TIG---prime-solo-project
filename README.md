## Description

the user is able to learn about the Polyvagal theory, check-in as often as they see fit to submit entries about how they are feeling at that moment through the lens of Polyvagal theory, and take stock after a while of submitting these entries to learn about their specific autonomic nervous system patterns. This is very empowering for the user because this knowledge could lead to taking actions for the betterment of their overall health in the specific way that works for their nervous system.

## Getting Started

This project should be able to run in your favorite IDE. I used VS code while building it.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

Node.js

### Installation

1-Fork the repository

2-Copy the SSH key in your new repository

3-In your terminal type... git clone {paste SSH link}

4-Navigate into the repository's folder in your terminal

5-Open VS Code (or editor of your choice) and open the folder

6-In the terminal of VS Code run npm install and npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled to install all dependencies

7-Create a .env file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret

8-Create a database named TIG_app in PostgresSQL If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change TIG_app to the name of your new database name in server/modules/pool.js

9-The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables that you need, as well as a dummy data table to test the app. Copy and paste those queries in the SQL query of the database. If this is going to production, leave out the dummy data.

10-Run npm run server in your VS Code terminal

11-Open a second terminal and run npm run client

## Usage

Once everything is installed and running it should open in your default browser - if not, navigate to
 
http://localhost:3000
